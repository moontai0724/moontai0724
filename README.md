# üëã Hi there, I'm ÊúàÂ§™ „Åí„Å§„Åü„ÅÑ MoonTai

A coder who is committed to improving and simplifying life.

Currently working hard on learning web technologies!

# Learning Skills

## Web technologies

I start develop web from [developing user-scripts](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=user-script), then goes to both front and back end.

JavaScript is my first place, I almost and I will still choose JavaScript as my program language when possible, I LOVE JavaScript.

### Front end

I use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) before, but now, I have built [more than 6 projects](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=vuejs) using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), includes [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Vue CLI and direct Vue.js include](https://vuejs.org).

At UI, I almost use [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/) now, but I've use [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) before.

### Back end

Also, I am learning [NextJS](https://nestjs.com/) by use it as my back end server in [some projects](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=nestjs), and also designed [at least 3 RESTful API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search?type=API&owner=moontai0724) in [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) spec for some project.

When goes to database, I use [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) at most, but sometimes uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). I always do a design by draw a ERD graphic before start a project.

Sometimes, I use [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script) with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets) to [save and collect some data](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=google-apps-script), it's really nice.

And I also developed many small tools to help me achieve something, like [some downloader](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=crowler).

Besides JavaScript, I have been using PHP before. Built [at least 10 projects](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=codeignite) in [CodeIgniter 3](https://codeigniter.com/) (not accessable in GitHub) and at least 2 in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (same, not accessable).

## Server Hosting and Management

Server hosting and management is not my main domain, but I also work a lot on this.

I've used lots of platforms to host my server, such like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/) and own PC.

I'm using [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) as my virtual environment management platform, and I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to serve my servers.

I've host reverse proxies to [proxy Minecraft traffics](https://github.com/moontai0724/haproxy-setup-shell-scripts) using [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/), also simple web proxy using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

Besides, I have host [Bind (DNS Server)](https://www.isc.org/bind/) before, and applies SSL with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), but now I uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) instead.

## Application Develpoment

Without web, I'm also worked in many types of programming.

I've developed [Android using both Java and Kotlin](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=android), and also developed [iOS in Swift](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=ios), it's a great experience. I mainly do this to know more about mobile develoeprs, this helps me to design API specs or manage projects more well.

Also, I've made a application by using [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/), I think I will do more with it (or just make PWA websites instead).

I also develop games using [Unity](https://github.com/moontai0724?tab=repositories&q=unity), but after that, I think I'm not good at game develop.

## Other Skills

Without programming, I love photographing. I've participating many technical conferances by become a photography team volunteer, like [SITCON](https://sitcon.org/), [COSCUP](https://coscup.org/), [HITCON](https://hitcon.org/), [JCConf](https://jcconf.tw/), [g0v hackathon](https://jothon.g0v.tw/), etc..., so I also uses [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), and I have learned [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) in school.

Besides these, I'm also do some films or videos before, now I use [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), but I use [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) before.
